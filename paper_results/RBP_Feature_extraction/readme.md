### RBP Feature Extraction



#### 1\. Global Feature Extraction



###### Using **Protein-BERT** to extract the global representations of proteins. Run **demo1.py**; the resulting **global\_representations** correspond to the global features of the proteins.



#### 2\. Local Feature Extraction

###### 

###### Using **TS2Vec** to extract local features of proteins. Feed the global\_representations into the **ts2vec** model by running **main.py** to obtain the local features.
